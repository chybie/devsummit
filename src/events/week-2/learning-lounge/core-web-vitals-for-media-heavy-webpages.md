More than 50% of page weight on an average is taken up by media elements like videos, images, GIFs and much more. Websites focusing on modern web formats like web stories and short form videos make use of these in even higher proportions. Lack of optimizations in this space can affect the page performance and in return the page experience, which is now one of the search ranking signals too. If you are one of the site owners struggling to tackle perf challenges due to the same, then this learning lounge is for you. Apart from sharing media optimization techniques, weâ€™ll also discuss about some of the modern adaptive rendering techniques you can apply to cater to your different types of audience sets, including the ones using low end devices on slower internet connections. You'll also learn about tooling available today which can help in choosing the right path for fixing the challenges that really matter.
