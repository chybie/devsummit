More and more, organizations understand that performance is a critical factor in the reach and overall effectiveness of their online experiences. But where to start? It can be challenging to weed through the myriad of advice and ""best practices"" floating around to find the improvements that will actually benefit you and the people using your site. All too often, teams spend large amounts of time applying optimizations only to find that they're unable to show meaningful improvements after the fact.

In this workshop, we'll walk through the process of auditing a site's performance to find meaningful improvements. We'll explore patterns to look for, how the gaps between metrics can help us zero in on bottlenecks, and how to accurately estimate how much impact an optimization may have, before you start to work on it.
