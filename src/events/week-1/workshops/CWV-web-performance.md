What do we mean when we talk about "web performance"? Why should you care about it? How can you measure and correlate it to user experiences and business outcomes? How do you get other people in your organization to care? Tammy has studied the intersection of web performance, usability, and business for more than ten years. In this workshop, she'll answer these questions and more â€“ including an overview of the history of performance metrics, up to and including Core Web Vitals.
