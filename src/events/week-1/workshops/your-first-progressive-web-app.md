In this hands-on workshop, you will code a Progressive Web App, an app that will be installable on Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, iOS, and iPadOS with offline capabilities and integration with the device. We will start creating icons and installable metadata for mobile and desktop with the Web App Manifest. After that, we will enhance the user interface with CSS before adding a Service Worker for offline support. Finally, we will work on distribution, generating an "Install" dialog from the browser and PWA Launchers for listing the PWA through the app stores.
