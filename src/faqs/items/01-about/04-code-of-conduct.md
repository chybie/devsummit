Even though the event is online, we want to make sure any interactions with Googlers and others from the community follow our code of conduct. We encourage everyone to review our [Community Guidelines](/devsummit/community-guidelines/) to ensure Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone.

We take our Community Guidelines seriously at Chrome Dev Summit, and the audience, speakers, and everyone involved with the event are required to agree to these guidelines. If you have any questions, contact [chrome-dev-summit-community@google.com](mailto:chrome-dev-summit-community@google.com).
