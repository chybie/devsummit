Chrome Dev Summit is an annual conference where developers can learn about the latest tools and updates coming to the Google Chrome browser.

Over the next few weeks, you’ll hear from Chrome product and engineering teams, industry leaders, and developers about building the future of the web. We’ll share platform updates, architectural guidance, developer tooling, case studies, and opportunities for increased reach and engagement. You’ll also have the opportunity to connect with Chrome leaders and developers live and level up your skills during one-on-one office hours, group workshops, and learning lounges.
