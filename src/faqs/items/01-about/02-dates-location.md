This year, Chrome Dev Summit is an online-only event. Visit [goo.gle/cds2021](/devsummit/) on November 3 to tune into our keynote and live ask me anything (AMA); hear the latest news and updates on the Chrome browser; and attend office hours, learning lounges, and workshops with product managers, developers, and engineers.

The workshops, office hours, and learning lounges will be held in three time zones so you can join whenever works best for you: US Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and Indian Standard Time (IST).
