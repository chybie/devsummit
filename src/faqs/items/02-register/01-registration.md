Registration is not required to watch the sessions. All sessions and content will be publicly available. The sessions will run live on Dec 9-10, 2020 starting from 9:30 am Pacific Time (expected run time c. 3 hours). After the event we'll post the sessions to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Developers YouTube Channel</a>; however, we encourage developers to join us during the livestream to get a chance to interact with Googlers live and ask their burning questions.
