title: If I can no longer attend a workshop or office hours, can I transfer my spot to someone else?

If you'd like to transfer your spot to a colleague, send a request to [chrome-dev-summit@google.com](mailto:chrome-dev-summit@google.com) and CC your colleague on the email. Your colleague will need to complete the registration form before we can transfer your spot.
