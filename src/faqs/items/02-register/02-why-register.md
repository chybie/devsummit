title: If the event is online and available to all, why do I need to request an invite or register?

While all sessions, live Q&A and other learning experiences such as Codelabs, etc (more details to follow) will be accessible to everyone on our event website, we have a few programs such as Workshops and Office Hours that have limited capacity. Invite requests are now closed but we hope youâ€™ll join us for the livestream on Dec 9-10, 2020.
